# PUBLISHER ISSUE SOLUTION GUIDE
# ================================

## CURRENT STATUS
‚úÖ Assembly metadata correctly configured with "GALIH RIDHO UTOMO"
‚úÖ File properties show correct publisher information
‚ùå UAC dialog still shows "Publisher: Unknown"

## ROOT CAUSE
Windows UAC ignores assembly metadata for unsigned executables.
Only digitally signed executables display publisher names in UAC dialogs.

## SOLUTIONS

### 1. PROFESSIONAL SOLUTION (Recommended for Distribution)
Purchase a Code Signing Certificate:
- Extended Validation (EV): $300-500/year - Immediate Windows SmartScreen trust
- Standard Code Signing: $100-200/year - Builds trust over time
- Providers: DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign, SSL.com

### 2. SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE (Testing Only)
- Free but shows security warnings
- Good for testing/internal use only
- Not recommended for public distribution

### 3. PUBLISHER DISPLAY WORKAROUND
While UAC will show "Unknown Publisher", you can:
- Include publisher info in installer (NSIS, WiX)
- Use proper branding in application dialogs
- Add certificate info to documentation

## CURRENT FILE STATUS
üìÅ publish-new/DungeonGame.exe - Latest build with all metadata
üìÅ Assembly info includes: GALIH RIDHO UTOMO
üìÅ File properties correctly show publisher
üìÅ Ready for code signing when certificate obtained

## NEXT STEPS
1. For production: Purchase EV Code Signing Certificate
2. For testing: Continue with current build
3. For distribution: Create installer with publisher branding

## SECURITY IMPACT
- Unsigned executables are flagged by SmartScreen
- May trigger antivirus false positives
- Users see "Unknown Publisher" warning
- Professional certificate resolves all issues
