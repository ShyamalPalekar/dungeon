# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

The Dungeon Game project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities responsibly.

## üìã Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            | Active |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No             | EOL    |

## üîí Security Measures

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Memory Safety**: .NET 9 provides memory-safe execution environment
- **File System**: Restricted file access with proper permission checks
- **Network**: No unauthorized network communications
- **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### AI/ML Security
- **Model Protection**: Q-Learning models are protected from tampering
- **Training Data**: No sensitive data used in AI training
- **Algorithm Safety**: AI behavior bounded within safe parameters
- **Performance Limits**: Resource usage monitoring and limits

### Data Privacy
- **No Telemetry**: Application doesn't collect or transmit user data
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally with user consent
- **Configuration**: Settings encrypted when containing sensitive data
- **Logging**: No sensitive information in log files

## üîç Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation issues
- Data corruption or loss scenarios
- AI model manipulation attacks
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure issues
- Cross-application data access
- Performance degradation attacks
- Configuration bypass issues

### Low Priority
- UI/UX security issues
- Non-critical information leaks
- Minor validation bypasses

## üì¢ Reporting Security Issues

### üö® **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues!

### Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **Email**: Send details to **security@galihutomo.dev** (if available) or create a private vulnerability report
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Message the project maintainer directly

### What to Include

Please provide the following information:
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Environment**: Operating system, .NET version, and application version
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code (if safe)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-14 days
  - Medium: 1-30 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

## üèÜ Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame
We maintain a security researchers hall of fame to recognize responsible disclosure:

<!-- Security researchers who have contributed to our security will be listed here -->

*No security issues reported yet.*

### Acknowledgments
- Responsible disclosure contributors will be acknowledged in release notes
- Credit given in vulnerability advisories (with permission)
- Recognition in our community channels

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
- **Download Only**: From official GitHub releases
- **Verify Checksums**: Check file integrity when provided
- **Windows Defender**: Keep Windows security features enabled
- **Admin Rights**: Only grant when necessary for installation

### Runtime Security
- **Firewall**: Monitor network access (though none should occur)
- **Antivirus**: Keep real-time protection enabled
- **Updates**: Install security updates promptly
- **Isolation**: Run in standard user context when possible

### Development Security
- **Dependencies**: Keep development dependencies updated
- **Code Review**: Review all code changes for security implications
- **Testing**: Include security test cases
- **Documentation**: Document security assumptions and requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks for NuGet packages
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review process
- **Testing**: Security-specific unit and integration tests

### Build Security
- **Signed Builds**: Code signing for release builds (when certificates available)
- **Supply Chain**: Secure build pipeline with verified dependencies
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process
- **Integrity**: Checksums and verification for releases

## üìö Security Resources

### Educational Materials
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

## üîÑ Policy Updates

This security policy is reviewed and updated:
- **Quarterly**: Regular policy review
- **As Needed**: After security incidents or major changes
- **Version Changes**: Updated with each major release

## üìû Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Project Lead**: GALIH RIDHO UTOMO
- **Security Email**: [Create security email if needed]
- **GitHub**: [@galihru](https://github.com/galihru)

### Emergency Contacts
For critical security issues requiring immediate attention:
1. GitHub Security Advisory (preferred)
2. Direct message to project maintainer
3. Create urgent issue with "SECURITY" prefix (for non-sensitive details only)

## üìñ Legal and Compliance

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
- We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure
- Public disclosure after fix is available and users have had time to update
- Credit to security researchers (with consent)
- No legal action against good-faith security research

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance where applicable
- User data privacy protection
- Minimal data collection principles
- User consent for any data processing
