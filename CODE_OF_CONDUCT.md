# Dungeon Game Community Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

The Dungeon Game community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone interested in AI-powered gaming, machine learning, and strategic gameplay. Our community includes players, developers, AI researchers, students, and enthusiasts from around the world.

## Our Values

Diversity is one of our greatest strengths. We welcome contributors and participants from all backgrounds and skill levels. To ensure everyone can participate meaningfully, we ask all community members to follow these guidelines.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Dungeon Game community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository discussions and issues
- Community forums and chat channels  
- Project documentation and wikis
- Social media interactions related to the project
- Events and meetups (virtual or in-person)
- Any other communication channels used by our community

Violations outside these spaces may also affect a person's ability to participate in our community.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

- **Be respectful and inclusive.** Treat everyone with dignity, regardless of their background, experience level, or perspective.

- **Be collaborative.** Remember that we're building something together. Share knowledge, help others learn, and celebrate collective achievements.

- **Be patient and supportive.** Not everyone has the same level of experience with AI, programming, or gaming. Be willing to help newcomers and answer questions constructively.

- **Communicate clearly and professionally.** Use clear language, stay on topic, and remember that text-based communication can be easily misunderstood.

- **Respect different viewpoints.** Encourage healthy debate about AI strategies, game mechanics, and technical approaches while remaining respectful of differing opinions.

- **Give credit where due.** Acknowledge the contributions of others, especially when sharing ideas, code, or strategies.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in our community:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Personal attacks, insults, or inflammatory language
- Posting inappropriate, offensive, or explicit content
- Sharing others' private information without consent
- Trolling, spamming, or deliberately disruptive behavior
- Threats of violence or violent language
- Advocating for or encouraging any prohibited behavior

## AI and Technical Discussions

When discussing AI algorithms, game strategies, or technical implementation:

- **Share knowledge responsibly.** Help others understand Q-Learning and machine learning concepts
- **Cite sources.** When referencing research papers, algorithms, or external resources
- **Be constructive in code reviews.** Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the person
- **Encourage experimentation.** Support community members trying new approaches or strategies

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Contact the maintainers** by creating a private issue or emailing the project team
2. **Provide details** about the incident, including when and where it occurred
3. **Preserve evidence** such as screenshots or links to relevant discussions

All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed promptly. We are committed to creating a safe space for everyone.

### Consequences

Violations may result in:
- Warning and request to change behavior
- Temporary suspension from community spaces
- Permanent ban from the project and community

## Questions and Clarifications

If you have questions about this Code of Conduct or need clarification on what constitutes appropriate behavior, please:

- Open a discussion in the community forums
